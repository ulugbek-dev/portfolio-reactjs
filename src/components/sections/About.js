            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a Web Developer specializing in Front-end Development and UI/UX Design. I have been working professionally in these fields for over 2 years. I'm always curious to create, to improvise and to deliver the best design that fits with what user wants and needs.
            <br />
            Very well experienced with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6, jQuery), Bootstrap and etc, as I have done a decent number of front-end projects using these languages and frameworks. My goal is to produce high quality, good organized and SEO-friendly code.</p>
